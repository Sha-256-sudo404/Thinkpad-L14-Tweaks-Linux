# Thinkpad-L14-Tweaks-Linux

TLP aggressive power-saving config for L14 Gen 1 ( mainly AMD, specifically R5 Pro 4650U )

Caution: ASPM should not be set to powersupersave for realtek wifi stability as per Archwiki and from personal testing

"The RTW89 kernel module has been merged into the upstream kernel and provides support for newer Realtek wireless chipsets.

This driver supports: 8852AE, 8851BE, 8852BE, and 8852CE.

On some computers, you may experience unstable connections. It seems like a common issue on late models from HP and Lenovo. Try disabling ASPM-related features using the config below. "
